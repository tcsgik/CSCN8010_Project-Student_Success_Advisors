    ChatbotController orchestrates the main components of the student-facing chatbot system.
    
    It integrates intent classification, emotion detection, vector-based knowledge retrieval,
    answer generation, and interaction logging. The controller processes incoming student queries
    by identifying their intent and emotional state in parallel. If distress is detected, it
    responds with a referral to a human advisor. Otherwise, it retrieves relevant context from the
    knowledge base and generates a user-friendly answer using a language model.
