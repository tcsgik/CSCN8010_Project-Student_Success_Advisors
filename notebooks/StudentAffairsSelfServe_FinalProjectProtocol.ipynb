Submit a formal appeal: If you are unsatisfied with the outcome of your discussion with the professor, or if you believe there was an error made, you can submit a formal appeal following the school's procedures.

      "5. Meet deadline: Make sure to submit your appeal within the specified deadline to ensure it is considered in a timely manner.\n",
