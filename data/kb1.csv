https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,0,"​Terminology: Grade Point Averages Save Send Feedback College commonly uses two types of Grade Point Averages (GPAs): Term Weighted Average (TWA): Represents your average grade for a specific term (or semester). Program Weighted Average (PWA): Reflects your cumulative average across your entire program. Definitions of these GPAs and details on how they are calculated are available on the Registrar’s Grading and Transcripts [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/grading-transcripts] webpage. Below, you will find a general overview as well as an explanation of older terminology that is gradually being phased out. Term Weighted Average The TWA represents the average grade achieved across all courses in a specific term (commonly referred to as a “semester”). This metric is used to assess your academic standing and progression in your program at the end of each term. There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing:"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,1,"There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing: Your TWA meets or exceeds the minimum average to graduate from your program. Note that this is often higher than the minimum grade required to earn a credit in a specific course. For example, the minimum grade to pass a course might be 55% but you could be required to have an average of at least 60% to graduate. Promotion on Probation: Your TWA is below the minimum average required to graduate from your program. Typically, the range is within 5%, though it is important to confirm this by reviewing the academic handbook [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook/student-guide] for your school. Important: If you are on probation for two consecutive terms (excluding scheduled breaks), you will be discontinued from the program. Program Discontinuance: You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,2,"You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options. When to Use Term Weighted Average The TWA is particularly useful at the end of one term and the start of the next, as it helps determine your academic standing and next steps. Where to Find It You can view your TWA once all final grades are posted to your record by accessing your Achievement Report through the Grades tab in your Student Portal. Program Weighted Average The PWA represents the average of all your course grades throughout your entire program. Sometimes it is also called a “Cohort Weighted Average”. It plays a critical role in determining your eligibility to graduate. Meeting the graduation requirements involves more than simply passing your courses; you must also achieve a minimum overall average: Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,3,"Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed. Specialized Programs: Some programs may have higher requirements to comply with external accreditation standards. Progression Requirements Guides for each school are available here: College College Academic Handbooks [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook] . When to Use Program Weighted Average The PWA is particularly useful if you are struggling in one or more courses. Mid-semester, it is important to evaluate how your current grades will impact your overall average and your ability to graduate in the future. Where to Find It Your PWA can be found in the “Achievement Report” section of the Student Portal. Older Terminology To improve clarity and usability, we have updated some key terms, and you will see this reflected in College policies: ""Term Weighted Average"" (TWA) replaces the older ""Session Weighted Average"""
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,4,"(TWA) replaces the older ""Session Weighted Average"" when referring to your average grade for a specific term (or semester). ""Program Weighted Average"" (PWA) is now used instead of ""Cohort Weighted Average"" to describe the average grade across your entire program.

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/87/academic-probation,0,"Academic Probation Save Send Feedback There are two levels of probation: Probation 1 (P1) and Probation 2 (P2). Students are placed on probation if they have a Term Weighted Average between 55 - 59.99% (unless otherwise stated in the Academic School Handbook [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook/index] ). Students on P1 are encouraged (not required) to meet with an SSA or their Program Coordinator to develop a learning plan. A learning plan is a document designed to support your academic achievement. Students who have a term weighted average in the same range for a second consecutive term will be placed on P2. Note: a scheduled break is ignored when determining consecutive semesters. When on P2, students are required to connect with an SSA or their program coordinator to develop a learning contract. This is a formal agreement that outlines the requirement for academic achievement."

This is a formal agreement that outlines the requirement for academic achievement. If a student's term weighted average remains in the same range after being on P2, they will be discontinued from their program. Important Notes Term Weighted Average is calculated using the grades for each course and adjusted for the number of credits associated with the course in which it was received. If a student is registered through part-time studies their course performance will be reflected in their cumulative weighted average. There is no term weighted average calculation for part-time studies unless they are registered in a program cohort. All students can attempt a course 2 times. For any subsequent attempts, the student must get approval from an academic administrator in the program in which they are registered."

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/85/is-counselling-for-me,0,"Is Counselling for Me? Save Send Feedback Many students find they struggle to cope with various pressures they experience at times. It can be hard to live on your own for the first time or adjust to living in a new country. You may be worried about your academic performance or have test-taking anxiety. You may be simply overwhelmed with having to juggle so many demands such as work, relationships and school. In life, we can also face unexpected events such as a death, loss of a relationship, or a traumatic event that can affect us significantly. Counselling is a safe space where you will not be judged for what you are thinking, feeling or doing. Meeting with a counsellor can help reduce your feelings of stress and help you develop new perspectives and strategies for moving forward. Counselling Myths Seeing a counsellor means I’m ""crazy,"" ""weak,"" or ""mentally ill."" My problems aren’t severe enough for counselling. I don’t have time to meet with a counsellor for many weeks."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/85/is-counselling-for-me,1,"My problems aren’t severe enough for counselling. I don’t have time to meet with a counsellor for many weeks. When we are in physical pain, we know it is okay to reach out to a doctor for help. It is equally okay to reach out to a counsellor when you are experiencing emotional pain. Counsellors can support students who struggle with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and self-harm behaviour. Counselling is also a great preventive resource to help deal with worries, lack of motivation, feeling lonely and relationship challenges. Counselling is not intended to eliminate all your problems or ""fix"" you. You are not broken! Once you start seeing a counsellor, it does not mean you need to keep seeing the counsellor for a long time - many students are surprised by the positive impact of just one session. What to Expect When you reach out to schedule your first appointment, you get to decide if you would like to meet with the counsellor in person, over the telephone or virtually."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/faqs/detail/85/is-counselling-for-me,2,"What to Expect When you reach out to schedule your first appointment, you get to decide if you would like to meet with the counsellor in person, over the telephone or virtually. You can also indicate if you prefer to meet with a male or female counsellor. During the appointment, you can expect a conversation where you and the counsellor discuss what has prompted you to reach out at this time. The counsellor will ask questions about your strengths, things that you have tried in the past, what you hope will change, or what needs to change to reduce your current stress level. The counsellor will help you set realistic goals for change and then work with you on how to make those changes happen.

Sometimes you may feel: Fear of making mistakes, lack of confidence in math. Fast heart beating, sweatiness, nausea when anticipating or engaging in math tasks. Wanting to quit when confused or making mistakes in math. Stress before evaluations such as tests, quizzes and exams. Nervous before math class. Procrastination of math homework or assignments. Unable to concentrate on a math task. Does math anxiety affect math ability? The video below explains more about what math anxiety is and does to your brain when you're experiencing it. Math anxiety and working memory Our working memory is a system in our brain responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information and is essential when solving most math problems. Our working memory can store very limited amounts of information."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,1,"Our working memory is a system in our brain responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information and is essential when solving most math problems. Our working memory can store very limited amounts of information. The amount of information our working memory can store at one time is sometimes referred to a s cognitive load. When our cognitive load has reached its maximum capacity, we stop processing information. Elevated levels of anxiety can affect working memory, decreasing its efficiency. This is not permanent and only occurs for the duration of time that the anxiety lasts. Since math requires working memory, trying to do math under high levels of anxiety can at times feel impossible. So what does this mean? Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety!"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,2,"Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety! When we learn to reduce the anxiety we feel when doing or anticipating math tasks, our working memory can process information much more easily and efficiently, making things seem more manageable. Myths about math Math comes with its stereotypes. Here are three things that are not true about math: People of different race and sex have varying innate math ability There is a best way to solve a math problem You have to have a 'math brain' to understand math Debunking math stereotypes can shed some positive light on the subject and our ability to improve our math skills. The next time you hear someone say any of the things above, remember they are not true!

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,3,"Strategies for overcoming and managing math anxiety The following strategies are things you can start doing today to help manage and overcome math anxiety. This list is not exhaustive and some things may work better for some people than others. There is no particular order in which you have to follow the strategies. Try whichever ones resonate best with you! Strengthen foundational math knowledge Math builds on itself. Imagine trying to calculate 5+7−4 without knowing how addition or subtractions works. This would be extremely difficult and could lead to things like lack of confidence, defeat, and frustration. Having strong foundational knowledge of the prerequisite skills needed for the math you are required to do will make things easier. When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,4,"When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time. The weaker your foundational math knowledge is, the more resources are taken up in working memory when solving a math problem, increasing cognitive load and leaving fewer brain resources for the steps required to solve the problem at hand. With a stronger math foundation, more working memory resources can be allocated to solving the problem at hand, and less on trying to understand the basics at the same time. The stronger our basics, the more math confidence you can build. Not sure what foundational knowledge you need to strengthen? Check out this list of foundational math skills.

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,0,"​Terminology: Grade Point Averages Save Send Feedback College commonly uses two types of Grade Point Averages (GPAs): Term Weighted Average (TWA): Represents your average grade for a specific term (or semester). Program Weighted Average (PWA): Reflects your cumulative average across your entire program. Definitions of these GPAs and details on how they are calculated are available on the Registrar’s Grading and Transcripts [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/grading-transcripts] webpage. Below, you will find a general overview as well as an explanation of older terminology that is gradually being phased out. Term Weighted Average The TWA represents the average grade achieved across all courses in a specific term (commonly referred to as a “semester”). This metric is used to assess your academic standing and progression in your program at the end of each term. There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing:"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,1,"There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing: Your TWA meets or exceeds the minimum average to graduate from your program. Note that this is often higher than the minimum grade required to earn a credit in a specific course. For example, the minimum grade to pass a course might be 55% but you could be required to have an average of at least 60% to graduate. Promotion on Probation: Your TWA is below the minimum average required to graduate from your program. Typically, the range is within 5%, though it is important to confirm this by reviewing the academic handbook [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook/student-guide] for your school. Important: If you are on probation for two consecutive terms (excluding scheduled breaks), you will be discontinued from the program. Program Discontinuance: You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,2,"You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options. When to Use Term Weighted Average The TWA is particularly useful at the end of one term and the start of the next, as it helps determine your academic standing and next steps. Where to Find It You can view your TWA once all final grades are posted to your record by accessing your Achievement Report through the Grades tab in your Student Portal. Program Weighted Average The PWA represents the average of all your course grades throughout your entire program. Sometimes it is also called a “Cohort Weighted Average”. It plays a critical role in determining your eligibility to graduate. Meeting the graduation requirements involves more than simply passing your courses; you must also achieve a minimum overall average: Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,3,"Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed. Specialized Programs: Some programs may have higher requirements to comply with external accreditation standards. Progression Requirements Guides for each school are available here: College College Academic Handbooks [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook] . When to Use Program Weighted Average The PWA is particularly useful if you are struggling in one or more courses. Mid-semester, it is important to evaluate how your current grades will impact your overall average and your ability to graduate in the future. Where to Find It Your PWA can be found in the “Achievement Report” section of the Student Portal. Older Terminology To improve clarity and usability, we have updated some key terms, and you will see this reflected in College policies: ""Term Weighted Average"" (TWA) replaces the older ""Session Weighted Average"""
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,4,"(TWA) replaces the older ""Session Weighted Average"" when referring to your average grade for a specific term (or semester). ""Program Weighted Average"" (PWA) is now used instead of ""Cohort Weighted Average"" to describe the average grade across your entire program. These updates aim to make the terminology more intuitive and reflective of their specific purposes.

Sometimes you may feel: Fear of making mistakes, lack of confidence in math. Fast heart beating, sweatiness, nausea when anticipating or engaging in math tasks. Wanting to quit when confused or making mistakes in math. Stress before evaluations such as tests, quizzes and exams. Nervous before math class. Procrastination of math homework or assignments. Unable to concentrate on a math task. Does math anxiety affect math ability? The video below explains more about what math anxiety is and does to your brain when you're experiencing it. Math anxiety and working memory Our working memory is a system in our brain responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information and is essential when solving most math problems. Our working memory can store very limited amounts of information."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/InfoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,1,"Our working memory is a system in our brain responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information and is essential when solving most math problems. Our working memory can store very limited amounts of information. The amount of information our working memory can store at one time is sometimes referred to a s cognitive load. When our cognitive load has reached its maximum capacity, we stop processing information. Elevated levels of anxiety can affect working memory, decreasing its efficiency. This is not permanent and only occurs for the duration of time that the anxiety lasts. Since math requires working memory, trying to do math under high levels of anxiety can at times feel impossible. So what does this mean? Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety!"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/InfoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,2,"Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety! When we learn to reduce the anxiety we feel when doing or anticipating math tasks, our working memory can process information much more easily and efficiently, making things seem more manageable. Myths about math Math comes with its stereotypes. Here are three things that are not true about math: People of different race and sex have varying innate math ability There is a best way to solve a math problem You have to have a 'math brain' to understand math Debunking math stereotypes can shed some positive light on the subject and our ability to improve our math skills. The next time you hear someone say any of the things above, remember they are not true!

This list is not exhaustive and some things may work better for some people than others. There is no particular order in which you have to follow the strategies. Try whichever ones resonate best with you! Strengthen foundational math knowledge Math builds on itself. Imagine trying to calculate 5+7−4 without knowing how addition or subtractions works. This would be extremely difficult and could lead to things like lack of confidence, defeat, and frustration. Having strong foundational knowledge of the prerequisite skills needed for the math you are required to do will make things easier. When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/InfoPages/detail/12/understanding-math-anxiety,4,"When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time. The weaker your foundational math knowledge is, the more resources are taken up in working memory when solving a math problem, increasing cognitive load and leaving fewer brain resources for the steps required to solve the problem at hand. With a stronger math foundation, more working memory resources can be allocated to solving the problem at hand, and less on trying to understand the basics at the same time. The stronger our basics, the more math confidence you can build. Not sure what foundational knowledge you need to strengthen? Check out this list of foundational math skills.

We will see that there are many other cases where we need to do this."

We will see that there are many other cases where we need to do this. Additionally, such problems not only arise in linear algebra, but in many other areas of mathematics, science, economics, business, et cetera. In real-world situations, we could easily have thousands of equations and thousands of variables. Thus, it is important to learn and understand the theory behind this, and not just simply memorize the method for solving small systems. Matrices and Linear Mappings In this module, we will look at matrices as objects rather than just as a tool for solving systems of linear equations. In doing so, we will be led to the idea of linear mappings. Vector Spaces In this module, we will extend lots of what we did with vectors in R n to general vector spaces."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/links/GoTo/62,4,"n to general vector spaces. In particular, we will look at spanning, linear independence, subspaces, and bases. We will then use this theory to precisely define dimension, and to look at coordinates of a vector with respect to a basis. Inverses and Determinants In this module, we will look at properties of invertible matrices, how to determine if a matrix is invertible using the determinant, and some of the uses of invertible matrices and determinants. Diagonalization We now look at one of the most important and useful pieces of linear algebra — diagonalization. In this module, we will need to use material from every module.

This is a formal agreement that outlines the requirement for academic achievement. If a student's term weighted average remains in the same range after being on P2, they will be discontinued from their program. Important Notes Term Weighted Average is calculated using the grades for each course and adjusted for the number of credits associated with the course in which it was received. If a student is registered through part-time studies their course performance will be reflected in their cumulative weighted average. There is no term weighted average calculation for part-time studies unless they are registered in a program cohort. All students can attempt a course 2 times. For any subsequent attempts, the student must get approval from an academic administrator in the program in which they are registered."

This is not permanent and only occurs for the duration of time that the anxiety lasts. Since math requires working memory, trying to do math under high levels of anxiety can at times feel impossible. So what does this mean? Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety!"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infopages/detail/12,2,"Anxiety can affect math performance no matter how good someone is at math. Our math skills may be just fine and we need to tackle the anxiety! When we learn to reduce the anxiety we feel when doing or anticipating math tasks, our working memory can process information much more easily and efficiently, making things seem more manageable. Myths about math Math comes with its stereotypes. Here are three things that are not true about math: People of different race and sex have varying innate math ability There is a best way to solve a math problem You have to have a 'math brain' to understand math Debunking math stereotypes can shed some positive light on the subject and our ability to improve our math skills. The next time you hear someone say any of the things above, remember they are not true!

This list is not exhaustive and some things may work better for some people than others. There is no particular order in which you have to follow the strategies. Try whichever ones resonate best with you! Strengthen foundational math knowledge Math builds on itself. Imagine trying to calculate 5+7−4 without knowing how addition or subtractions works. This would be extremely difficult and could lead to things like lack of confidence, defeat, and frustration. Having strong foundational knowledge of the prerequisite skills needed for the math you are required to do will make things easier. When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/infopages/detail/12,4,"When you attempt to solve a math problem without the required foundational knowledge, your working memory can become overloaded. Cognitive load is the amount of information that can be stored in working memory at one time. The weaker your foundational math knowledge is, the more resources are taken up in working memory when solving a math problem, increasing cognitive load and leaving fewer brain resources for the steps required to solve the problem at hand. With a stronger math foundation, more working memory resources can be allocated to solving the problem at hand, and less on trying to understand the basics at the same time. The stronger our basics, the more math confidence you can build. Not sure what foundational knowledge you need to strengthen? Check out this list of foundational math skills.

Watch the artist YouTube video [LINK: https://youtu.be/zYM2flt7t0s] to learn more about the design and story behind this years National Indigenous Peoples Day mural. Artist Statement: A circle of lifeforms moves together, each shape holding space for the next. This year’s mural honours the Anishinàbe worldview of interconnectedness, illustrating how all beings — animal, plant, sky, water, and land — are woven together into the delicate fabric of life. The gentle flow of forms reminds us of the humility required to know our place within, not above, the natural world. In this circle, the anishinàbe (person) is no more vital than the makwa (bear), nor is the ininatig (maple) greater than the nigig (otter)."

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/85/is-counselling-for-me,0,"Is Counselling for Me? Save Send Feedback Many students find they struggle to cope with various pressures they experience at times. It can be hard to live on your own for the first time or adjust to living in a new country. You may be worried about your academic performance or have test-taking anxiety. You may be simply overwhelmed with having to juggle so many demands such as work, relationships and school. In life, we can also face unexpected events such as a death, loss of a relationship, or a traumatic event that can affect us significantly. Counselling is a safe space where you will not be judged for what you are thinking, feeling or doing. Meeting with a counsellor can help reduce your feelings of stress and help you develop new perspectives and strategies for moving forward. Counselling Myths Seeing a counsellor means I’m ""crazy,"" ""weak,"" or ""mentally ill."" My problems aren’t severe enough for counselling. I don’t have time to meet with a counsellor for many weeks."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/students/Faqs/detail/85/is-counselling-for-me,1,"My problems aren’t severe enough for counselling. I don’t have time to meet with a counsellor for many weeks. When we are in physical pain, we know it is okay to reach out to a doctor for help. It is equally okay to reach out to a counsellor when you are experiencing emotional pain. Counsellors can support students who struggle with anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and self-harm behaviour. Counselling is also a great preventive resource to help deal with worries, lack of motivation, feeling lonely and relationship challenges. Counselling is not intended to eliminate all your problems or ""fix"" you. You are not broken! Once you start seeing a counsellor, it does not mean you need to keep seeing the counsellor for a long time - many students are surprised by the positive impact of just one session. What to Expect When you reach out to schedule your first appointment, you get to decide if you would like to meet with the counsellor in person, over the telephone or virtually."

You can also indicate if you prefer to meet with a male or female counsellor. During the appointment, you can expect a conversation where you and the counsellor discuss what has prompted you to reach out at this time. The counsellor will ask questions about your strengths, things that you have tried in the past, what you hope will change, or what needs to change to reduce your current stress level. The counsellor will help you set realistic goals for change and then work with you on how to make those changes happen.

https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/s/student-success-advising/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,0,"​Terminology: Grade Point Averages Save Send Feedback College commonly uses two types of Grade Point Averages (GPAs): Term Weighted Average (TWA): Represents your average grade for a specific term (or semester). Program Weighted Average (PWA): Reflects your cumulative average across your entire program. Definitions of these GPAs and details on how they are calculated are available on the Registrar’s Grading and Transcripts [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/grading-transcripts] webpage. Below, you will find a general overview as well as an explanation of older terminology that is gradually being phased out. Term Weighted Average The TWA represents the average grade achieved across all courses in a specific term (commonly referred to as a “semester”). This metric is used to assess your academic standing and progression in your program at the end of each term. There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing:"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/s/student-success-advising/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,1,"There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing: Your TWA meets or exceeds the minimum average to graduate from your program. Note that this is often higher than the minimum grade required to earn a credit in a specific course. For example, the minimum grade to pass a course might be 55% but you could be required to have an average of at least 60% to graduate. Promotion on Probation: Your TWA is below the minimum average required to graduate from your program. Typically, the range is within 5%, though it is important to confirm this by reviewing the academic handbook [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook/student-guide] for your school. Important: If you are on probation for two consecutive terms (excluding scheduled breaks), you will be discontinued from the program. Program Discontinuance: You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options."

During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options. When to Use Term Weighted Average The TWA is particularly useful at the end of one term and the start of the next, as it helps determine your academic standing and next steps. Where to Find It You can view your TWA once all final grades are posted to your record by accessing your Achievement Report through the Grades tab in your Student Portal. Program Weighted Average The PWA represents the average of all your course grades throughout your entire program. Sometimes it is also called a “Cohort Weighted Average”. It plays a critical role in determining your eligibility to graduate. Meeting the graduation requirements involves more than simply passing your courses; you must also achieve a minimum overall average: Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed."
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/s/student-success-advising/faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,3,"Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required.

Progression Requirements Guides for each school are available here: College College Academic Handbooks [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook] . When to Use Program Weighted Average The PWA is particularly useful if you are struggling in one or more courses. Mid-semester, it is important to evaluate how your current grades will impact your overall average and your ability to graduate in the future. Where to Find It Your PWA can be found in the “Achievement Report” section of the Student Portal. Older Terminology To improve clarity and usability, we have updated some key terms, and you will see this reflected in College policies: ""Term Weighted Average"" (TWA) replaces the older ""Session Weighted Average"""

""Program Weighted Average"" (PWA) is now used instead of ""Cohort Weighted Average"" to describe the average grade across your entire program.

Students on P1 are encouraged (not required) to meet with an SSA or their Program Coordinator to develop a learning plan. A learning plan is a document designed to support your academic achievement. Students who have a term weighted average in the same range for a second consecutive term will be placed on P2. Note: a scheduled break is ignored when determining consecutive semesters.

Below, you will find a general overview as well as an explanation of older terminology that is gradually being phased out. Term Weighted Average The TWA represents the average grade achieved across all courses in a specific term (commonly referred to as a “semester”). This metric is used to assess your academic standing and progression in your program at the end of each term. There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing:"
https://successportal.collegec.on.ca/s/student-success-advising/Faqs/detail/91/terminology-grade-point-averag,1,"There are three possible outcomes based on your TWA: Promotion with Good Academic Standing: Your TWA meets or exceeds the minimum average to graduate from your program. Note that this is often higher than the minimum grade required to earn a credit in a specific course. For example, the minimum grade to pass a course might be 55% but you could be required to have an average of at least 60% to graduate. Promotion on Probation: Your TWA is below the minimum average required to graduate from your program. Typically, the range is within 5%, though it is important to confirm this by reviewing the academic handbook [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook/student-guide] for your school. Important: If you are on probation for two consecutive terms (excluding scheduled breaks), you will be discontinued from the program. Program Discontinuance: You may need to pause your studies for at least one term. During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options."

During this time, you can explore part-time courses or other program options. When to Use Term Weighted Average The TWA is particularly useful at the end of one term and the start of the next, as it helps determine your academic standing and next steps. Where to Find It You can view your TWA once all final grades are posted to your record by accessing your Achievement Report through the Grades tab in your Student Portal. Program Weighted Average The PWA represents the average of all your course grades throughout your entire program. Sometimes it is also called a “Cohort Weighted Average”. It plays a critical role in determining your eligibility to graduate. Meeting the graduation requirements involves more than simply passing your courses; you must also achieve a minimum overall average: Certificates and Diplomas: Typically, a minimum PWA of 60% is required. Degree Programs: Generally, a minimum PWA of 65% is needed."

Progression Requirements Guides for each school are available here: College College Academic Handbooks [LINK: https://www.collegec.on.ca/handbook] . When to Use Program Weighted Average The PWA is particularly useful if you are struggling in one or more courses. Mid-semester, it is important to evaluate how your current grades will impact your overall average and your ability to graduate in the future. Where to Find It Your PWA can be found in the “Achievement Report” section of the Student Portal.
