# Project Name: AI-Enhanced Self-Service Portal for Student Affairs: A Proof of Concept

## Project Synopsis

Student Success Advisors (SSAs) are currently overwhelmed by low-complexity, high-volume inquiries. A reduction in SSA staffing highlights the urgent need for a scalable solution. This project proposes the design and implementation of a chatbot-based self-service tool to handle frequently asked questions (FAQs), integrated with a fallback mechanism ("off-ramp") to escalate complex queries to human advisors.
