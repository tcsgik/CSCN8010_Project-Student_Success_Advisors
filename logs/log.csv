1. Student Portal: You can make a payment directly in the Student Portal under the Financial tab, then select Program Fees Payment. This accepts credit card and is the fastest payment method.

2. Web Banking: You can make a payment directly through your Mobile Banking App by adding College College as a payee and using your Student ID as the account number.

3. Flywire or Convera (for international funds): Information can be found on the college's website under International > Apply to College > Fees and payment > Payment options.

Please note that all payments must be received and posted on the Student Portal by the fee due date for each term. Consider processing times to ensure the payments are received on or before the due date - allow 24 hours for payments through the Student Portal and 3-5 business days for web banking and international payment methods."
